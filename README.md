# Rotation-Tweeter
A Twitter bot (@shs_rotation, give it a follow!) that tweets out the day's class rotation schedule for Shaker High School.
Built using Python 3.5 and Tweepy. Run daily @ 6:30 AM EST using PythonAnywhere.

I wrote this bot as an example for the Twitter bots workshop held by Shaker Coding Club on 10/11/2016. More code examples, as well as my lesson plan can be found at https://github.com/shakercodingclub/twitterbots
